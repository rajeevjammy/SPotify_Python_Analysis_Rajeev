Spotify Tracks Data Analysis in Python
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Spotify track data to uncover patterns and insights related to audio features such as popularity, danceability, energy, tempo, and more. Using Python, we explore, clean, and visualize data from Spotify’s track list dataset to understand the trends in music across genres, artists, and years.

The analysis helps answer questions like:

What makes a track popular on Spotify?

How have musical characteristics evolved over time?

Which artists and genres dominate the charts?

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains metadata and audio features for various Spotify tracks.

Key columns include:

track_name – Name of the track

artist_name – Name of the artist

album_name – Album the track belongs to

release_date – Date when the track was released

genre – Genre of the track

popularity – Popularity score (0–100)

danceability – How suitable the track is for dancing

energy – Perceived energy level of the track

tempo – Estimated tempo (BPM)

valence – Musical positivity of the track

(You can use the Kaggle dataset: Spotify Tracks Dataset
)

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python 3.x

Pandas – For data manipulation and cleaning

NumPy – For numerical computation

Matplotlib / Seaborn – For data visualization
